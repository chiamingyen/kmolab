computational thinking and digitally literate

運算思維與數位化教育

Computing has deep links with mathematics, science and design and technology, and provides insights into both natural and artificial systems.

運算與數學、科學、設計及科技都有很緊密的關聯, 能讓我們充份了解自然或人造的系統.

Computing also ensures that pupils become digitally literate – able to use, and express themselves and develop their ideas through, information and communication technology – at a level suitable for the future workplace and as active participants in a digital world.

運算同時確保學習者俱備數位認知, 能夠運用、表達並透過資訊與通訊科技開展理念, 並在未來的數位世界職場中成為積極的參與者.

Aims:

運算教育的目標:

can understand and apply the fundamental principles and concepts of computer science, including abstraction, logic, algorithms and data representation

能夠了解並應用電腦科學的基本原理與概念, 包括抽象、邏輯, 演算法, 以及數據表達.

can analyse problems in computational terms, and have repeated practical experience of writing computer programs in order to solve such problems

能夠透過運算術語分析問題, 並且運用多重的程式編寫實務經驗, 來解決問題.

can evaluate and apply information technology, including new or unfamiliar technologies, analytically to solve problems

能夠應用資訊科技, 對全新或原本並不熟悉的科技進行評量, 能夠採解析方法解決各種問題.

are responsible, competent, confident and creative users of information and communication technology

成為肯負責、能勝任、具備信心與創意的資訊及通信科技使用者.
